            I am a University of Waterloo student looking for software oriented
            co-op and internship opportunities! I have strong experience as a
            full-stack developer and am familiar with front-end and back-end
            frameworks, relational databases, CI/CD tools, and select cloud
            services.

          <h1 class="subtitle1Primary">My Story</h1>
          <p class="textPrimary">
            I was born in China, immigrated to Canada at the tender age of 3,
            and have lived in Mississauga, ON ever since. Immigrating to a new
            country is not always a smooth process, with cultural barriers,
            financial difficulties, and anxiety due to a new environment
            pressuring you at all times of the day, however it has never stopped
            me from doing the things I loved doing. My mother was a software
            engineer, and thus I have been exposed to programming at an early
            age, creating text based games using C#. I taught middle school
            classmates C# during lunches, and I carried on that tradition
            throughout highschool, teaching students at a local middle school
            about Python. I became extremely interested in competitive
            programming and math competitions during this time, and accomplished
            much in Canadian competitions. Eventually, I graduated and finished
            the International Baccalaureate program at Glenforest Secondary
            School and was accepted into the University of Waterloo with a $10
            000 math faculty scholarship and a president's distinction award
            bursary. Growing up has had its own challenges, however it is due to
            them that I am where I am today!

          <h1 class="subtitle1Primary">My Values</h1>
          <p class="textPrimary">
            I believe in doing the best I can in anything I do, and I apply that
            to software as well. I strive to create code to the highest quality
            that I can. I believe in taking responsibility for my actions, which
            include owning up to mistakes, and the duty of providing the best
            for users of the works I contribute to. I believe you can improve
            the most just by starting something and that you should never back
            down from another opportunity to learn when presented with one. I
            believe that working together in diverse teams enables the entire
            group to formulate more innovative ideas and create a more
            outstanding product than what just one person can do. I believe that
            software can bring a smile on someone's face and that the work I do
            truly makes a difference.
