              I am a University of Waterloo student looking for software oriented co-op and internship opportunities! I have strong experience as a full-stack developer and am familiar with front-end and back-end frameworks, relational databases, CI/CD tools, and select cloud services.

              My Story
            </h1>
            <p class="textPrimary">
              I was born in China, immigrated to Canada at the tender age of 3, and have lived in Mississauga, ON ever since. Immigrating to a new country is not always a smooth process, with cultural barriers, financial difficulties, and anxiety due to a new environment pressuring you at all times of the day, however it has never stopped me from doing the things I loved doing. My mother was a software engineer, and thus I have been exposed to programming at an early age, creating text based games using C#. I taught middle school classmates C# during lunches, and I carried on that tradition throughout highschool, teaching students at a local middle school about Python. I became extremely interested in competitive programming and math competitions during this time, and accomplished much in Canadian competitions. Eventually, I graduated and finished the International Baccalaureate program at Glenforest Secondary School and was accepted into the University of Waterloo with a $10 000 math faculty scholarship and a president's distinction award bursary. Growing up has had its own challenges, however it is due to them that I am where I am today!

              My Values

            <p class="textPrimary">
              I believe in doing the best I can in anything I do, and I apply that to software as well. I strive to create code to the highest quality that I can. I believe in taking responsibility for my actions, which include owning up to mistakes, and the duty of providing the best for users of the works I contribute to. I believe you can improve the most just by starting something and that you should never back down from another opportunity to learn when presented with one. I believe that working together in diverse teams enables the entire group to formulate more innovative ideas and create a more outstanding product than what just one person can do. I believe that software can bring a smile on someone's face and that the work I do truly makes a difference.
